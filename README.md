# Project Description
This was a single-page React application created in Visual Studio Code using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for Mobile Development (DIG 4639). This project is meant to showcase the creator's portfolio of school/work experience as well as display several examples of work in web design, graphic design, video editing, and art.

# Features
This project includes responsive navigation and layout, functional links to external sites, and a contact form that checks whether users entered correctly formatted information (in the email field). The form also prevents users from submitting if they have not entered information in any one of the fields.

# Setup Instructions:
In order to set up this project on your own device, please ensure you have installed Node.js (NPM), Git, and a code editor (such as Visual Studio Code).
Then enter the following terminal commands:

- git clone https://github.com/raineponce/react-portfolio.git
- cd react-portfolio
- npm install
- npm run dev

Alternatively, the portfolio application may be viewed here: [https://raineponce.github.io/react-portfolio/](https://raineponce.github.io/react-portfolio/)

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
